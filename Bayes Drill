Bayes Drill

A diagnostic test has a 98% probability of giving a positive result when applied to a person suffering from Thripshaw's Disease, and 10% probability of giving a (false) positive when applied to a non-sufferer. It is estimated that 0.5 % of the population are sufferers. Suppose that the test is now administered to a person whose disease status is unknown. Calculate the probability that the test will:

1) Give a positive result.

	There are two ways there will be a positive result:

	Correct result for an infected person:

		P(I)P(Pos|I) = (.005)(.98)=0.0049

	False positive for a healthy person

		P(`I)P(Pos|`I)= (0.995)(.10)=0.0995

	Together  P(Pos)= 0.1044

2)	Correctly diagnose a sufferer of Thripshaw's

	.98 as given

3)	Correctly diagnose a non-sufferer of Thripshaw's

    .9

4)	Misclassify a randomly selected person

	(.995)(.1)+(0.005)(.02)=0.0996
