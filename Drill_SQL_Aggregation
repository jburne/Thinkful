1) What was the hottest day in our data set? Where was that?

SELECT
	ZIP, MAX(MaxTemperatureF) AS Hottest
FROM
	weather
GROUP BY 
	ZIP;

And it appears the hottest recorded temperature was 134 in zip code 94063.  I would guess that is in error, especially given it happened in NOVEMBER in Redwood City.  Their all-time record high temperature is 110.

2) How many trips started at each station?

SELECT 
	start_station AS origin,
	COUNT(*)
FROM trips
GROUP BY
	start_station
ORDER BY
	start_station;

3) What's the shortest trip that happened? (This would have to be assumed to be length of time, as we couldn't assume trips went directly station to station) 

SELECT 
	MIN(duration) 
FROM
	trips

The answer is 60 minutes, and I suppose that this bike share program has a "first hour free" clause. Hummm: The webpage I looked up said the first 30 minutes are free.

4) What is the average trip duration, by end station?

SELECT 
	end_station AS finish,
	ROUND(AVG(duration)) AS typicalTrip
FROM
	trips
GROUP BY
	end_station
ORDER BY
	end_station
