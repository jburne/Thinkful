    "### Explanation of the program, from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_Allowance_Rebate_System)\n",
    "The Car Allowance Rebate System (CARS), colloquially known as \"cash for clunkers\", was a 3 billion dollar U.S. federal scrappage program intended to provide economic incentives to U.S. residents to purchase a new, more fuel-efficient vehicle when trading in a less fuel-efficient vehicle. The program was promoted as providing stimulus to the economy by boosting auto sales, while putting safer, cleaner, and more fuel-efficient vehicles on the roadways.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Eligibility criteria\n",
    "- Vehicle must be less than 25 years old on the trade-in date.\n",
    "- Only the purchase or 5 year minimum lease of new vehicles qualify.\n",
    "- Generally, trade-in vehicles must get a weighted combined average rating of 18 or fewer miles per gallon (some very large pickup trucks and cargo vans have different requirements).\n",
    "- Trade-in vehicles must be registered and insured continuously for the full year preceding the trade-in.\n",
    "- Trade-in vehicles must be in driveable condition.\n",
    "- The new car bought under the plan must have a suggested retail price of no more than 45,000 dollars, and for passenger automobiles, the new vehicle must have a combined fuel economy value of at least 22 mpg‑US (There were some allowances for high occupancy vehicles and trucks)"

Clearly some of the vehicles listed as \"Trucks\" are not Trucks or even on a truck chassis. Examples from the New Vehicle data: Chevy Aveo, Cobalt, Impala, HHR are all listed as \"Category 1 truck\". Clearly something is messed up. Fortunately the MPG dataset includes a Category description as well. (See below.)\n",

    "1. While there is something to be said for dealer profits from maintaining older cars, this is a a minimal concern as most repairs of 10+ year old cars don't happen at a dealer nor do they typically use factory parts.  Thus I take it as an axiom that virtually all benefit to car companies flow from sales of new vehiclees. <br>\n",
    "2. Because of inherent difference between the size of corporations, we must consider the percentage of sales through this program and that of nearby time periods without this program. Those with a marked diffference between their usual sales market and their \"piece\" of the Cash for Clunkers program can be considered as benefitting (or perhaps being harmed by) the program.\n",
    "3. While it might be interesting to consider this question brand by brand, I am chosing to group by the largest corporation "

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Of the historic \"Big Three\" auto companies usually considered \"American Companies\" only Ford was able to hold onto their 2008 market share.  Chrysler lost some ground but not nearly as badly as GM. Hyundai/Kia had just finished building their production plants in the US and had a large unsold inventory.  This shift in market share could easily be thought of as the entry of a determined new competitor to the US marketplace with little to do with this program."
