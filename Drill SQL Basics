Drill SQL Basics
John Burnette

Write SQL queries to return:

1) The IDs and durations for all trips of duration greater than 500, ordered by duration.

SELECT 
	trip_id, 
	duration 
FROM 
	trips
WHERE 
	duration>500
ORDER BY 
	duration;

2) Every column of the stations table for station id 84.


SELECT 
	*
FROM 
	stations
WHERE 
	Station_id = 84;

3) The min temperatures of all the occurrences of rain in zip 94301.

SELECT 
	MinTemperatureF
FROM 
	weather
WHERE 
	ZIP = 94301 AND
	Events LIKE 'Rain';
