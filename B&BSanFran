B&B San Fran

** Spend a few minutes getting up to speed on the database schema. 
** There are three tables: sfo_calendar, sfo_listings, and sfo_reviews.

There are actually more tables than this, but those three are included.
It's possible that someone mistakenly created these other tables and added them to the database by mistake.  I'll endeavor to answer the questions with only the three tables listed above.
 
sfo_calendar
	listing_id  (bigint)
	calender_date	(date: Curious that calender is misspelled here)
	available		(character: seems to be f, t -- perhaps it 
					 should be a boolean?)
	price			(price: text but clearly seems to be $xxx.xx 
					 or null)

sfo_listings
	id 					(bigint: might not be listing_id but rather 
				 	 	transaction id?)
	name				(text: pretty clearly discription of unit)
	host_id				(bigint)
	host_name			(text)
	neighbourhood_group	(text)
	neighbourhood 		(text)
	latitude			(text: pretty clearly should be real)
	longitude			(text: pretty clearly should be real)
	room_type			(text: but with limited choices, probably 		
						 created with pull down)
	price				(real: but all seem to be integers)
	minimum_nights		(integer)
	number_of_reviews	(integer)
	last_review			(date)
	review_per_month	(real)
	calculated_host_listings_count
						(integer: I suppose because multiple listing per host.)
	availability_365	(text: Not sure why not an integer. Some 
						 entries with ?)

sfo_reviews
	listing_id			(bigint)
	id 					(bigint: This is a transaction id)
	review_date			(date)
	reviewer_id			(bigint)
	reviewer_name		(text)
	comments			(text)

Once you have your database set up, run some queries to start understanding San Francisco's Airbnbs. Here are some questions you should try to answer:

1)	What's the most expensive listing? What else can you tell me about 
	the listing?

	I presume I'm supposed to answer with only the three tables given above.

	SELECT * FROM sfo_listings
	ORDER BY price DESC
	LIMIT 1

	The most expensive listing is for $10000, but is a full house, 7500
	SQ FT, four floors with a hot tub.  Owned by Sarah;, the house is in the Western Addition neighborhood.  The minimum number of days to rent is 2.  The house had an "availablility_365" value of 18, which means a) it is only available 18 days per year or b) it was rented almost every day. Given the limited number of reviews, I would guess it's available only a limited number of days.

	Let's see what the  calendar says about it:

	SELECT * FROM sfo_calendar
	WHERE 
		listing_id=24650875 AND available='t'
	ORDER BY
		calender_date

	This returns 28 instances where the property was listed as 
	"available."  To find out if that's when rental COULD have occured versus being the only time when it wasn't rented, I'll match these 28 dates with the dates from the reviews.

	WITH
		avail_dates
	AS 	(
		SELECT 
			listing_id, 
			calender_date, 
			price 
		FROM sfo_calendar
		WHERE 
			listing_id=24650875 AND available='t'
		)
	SELECT
		ad.listing_id,
		ad.calender_date,
		r.review_date,
		r.listing_id,
		ad.price
	FROM
		avail_dates ad
	JOIN
		sfo_reviews r
	ON
		ad.listing_id = r.listing_id

	--> 24650875	2018-12-29	2018-05-09	24650875	$9,875.00

	****************************************
	What??  How do i get a review dated BEFORE the listing.
	I think I might not know what the data means.
	****************************************

	SELECT comments FROM sfo_reviews
	WHERE listing_id=24650875

	The four comments were all very postive

	"Gorgeous home. Terrific hosts. Was amazing place for our crew to return to and work/relax after long days."


	"My friends and I travelled to San Francisco for a wedding. Everyone agreed the home was beautiful and spacious. The hosts, Sarah and Jason, were also super pleasant to deal with. Overall, would 100% recommend this home to anyone looking for a place to stay in San Francisco."

	"The house was perfect for the 7 adults and 1 infant we had with us. The location was great, kitchen was amazing, and the family loved the projector viewing for movies and basketball. We would definitely rent again."

	"Sarahâ€™s home is beautiful!  It is comfy, clean, spacious, and in a great neighborhood.  We will certainly be back!"

	MUSINGS: the number of reviews is 3, yet there are 4 reviews, so I thought perhpas that the reviews are for the HOST, not the
	specific unit.  Let's explore this a little bit.

	SELECT * FROM sfo_listings
	WHERE host_id=6460979

	Conclusion: there is something wrong with the column of "reviews"

	SECOND ATTEMPT:

	Let's assume that the highest priced house is the one with the highest AVERAGE cost per night.

	SELECT 
		listing_id,
		AVG(CAST(replace(replace (price,'$',''),',','') AS float)) ave_pr
	FROM sfo_calendar
	WHERE price IS NOT NULL AND available = 't'
	GROUP BY listing_id
	ORDER BY ave_pr DESC;

	This is remarkably curious as my highest price home is now
	listing_id 1059961 with an average price of $106955.62 which 
	bears investigating.  

	SELECT 
		*
	FROM sfo_calendar
	WHERE listing_id = 1059961

	Sure enough, it does command that high a price.  Let's find out more about the house.

	WITH
		avail_dates
	AS 	(
		SELECT 
			listing_id, 
			calender_date, 
			price 
		FROM sfo_calendar
		WHERE 
			listing_id=1059961 AND available='t'
		)
	SELECT
		ad.listing_id,
		ad.calender_date,
		r.review_date,
		r.listing_id,
		r.comments,
		ad.price,
		l.name,
		l.neighbourhood,
		l.room_type
	FROM
		avail_dates ad
	JOIN
		sfo_reviews r
	ON
		ad.listing_id = r.listing_id
	JOIN
		sfo_listings l
	ON
		ad.listing_id = l.id

	THIS JUST DOESN'T PASS THE "SNIFF TEST". SO I'M GOING TO MOVE ON TO QUESTION 2.

	****************************************************************
	****************************************************************

2)	What neighborhoods seem to be the most popular?

	(a) "Which neighborhoods seem to be the most expensive?"

		See below

	(b) "Which neighborhoods seem have the highest ave percentage 	
		rented?"

	SELECT
		neighbourhood,
		CAST( 
			AVG(CAST(availability_365 AS INT)) 
			AS 
			NUMERIC(6,2)) ave_avail
	FROM
		sfo_listings
	WHERE availability_365 <> '?'
	GROUP BY neighbourhood
	ORDER BY ave_avail DESC

	The results say that the top 3 "neighbourhoods" by 
	rental actively were Lakeshore, Presidio, and Nob Hill

	*******************************************************
	Going by price per neighbourhood I get the top three as
	Nob Hill, South of Market, and Western Addition.

	SELECT 
		cal.listing_id,
		l.neighbourhood,
		COUNT(*),
		AVG(CAST(replace(replace (cal.price,'$',''),',','') AS float)) ave_pr_by_neigh
			 
	FROM sfo_calendar cal
	JOIN sfo_listings l
	ON cal.listing_id = l.id
	WHERE cal.price IS NOT NULL AND available = 't'
	GROUP BY cal.listing_id, l.neighbourhood 
	ORDER BY ave_pr_by_neigh DESC;

	BUT --- I know that there are some really extreme values
	in this data so perhaps MEDIAN is better than average.  Let's 
	see if makes a difference. SUPRISE -- MEDIAN is not a 
	"thing" in SQL.

	*******************************************************
	Finally, if we were going by "popular" as "something home
	owners do in this neighbourhood..." we'd want to rank the 
	neighbourhoods by number of B&Bs which exist.

	SELECT 
		neighbourhood,
		COUNT(id) bbs			 
	FROM sfo_listings
	GROUP BY neighbourhood 
	ORDER BY bbs DESC;

	By this criteria, the top three neighbourhoods are Mission, 
	Western Addition, and South of Market.

	****************************************************************
	****************************************************************
3a)	What time of year is the cheapest time to go to San Francisco? 

	The quickest way would be to sort the average cost by
	date.

	SELECT 
		calender_date, 
		AVG(CAST(replace(replace(price,'$',''),',','') AS float)) ave_cost
	FROM
		sfo_calendar
	WHERE 
		available = 't'
	GROUP BY 
		calender_date
	ORDER BY 
		ave_cost DESC

	****************************************************************
	But to get it sorted by month, it turns out it's september

	SELECT 
		EXTRACT(MONTH FROM calender_date) month_of_listing,
		AVG(CAST(replace(replace (price,'$',''),',','') AS float)) ave_pr
	FROM sfo_calendar
	GROUP BY month_of_listing
	ORDER BY ave_pr DESC
	****************************************************************
3b)	What time of year is the busiest time for B&Bs in San Francisco? 

	I would think that just a simple counting of total B&B's rented per 
	day would suffice for this, so it will be almost the same as above
	only we want to just COUNT how many units were rented, not worrying\
	about the cost.

	SELECT 
		EXTRACT(MONTH FROM calender_date) month_of_listing,
		COUNT(available) rented
	FROM sfo_calendar
	GROUP BY month_of_listing
	HAVING available = 't'
	ORDER BY rented DESC

	The months with the greatest number of units rented was November,
	January, and December.  Curiously, the most expensive month was
	the LEAST busiest.  Wondering why this is.  Well there's this thing
	called "Dreamforce" right in the middle of September...
