Data Sources

1)	The Dutch take Christmas very seriously so AirBnB which are booked on Christmas eve will likely be in locations aligned with Christmas festivities -- perhaps under estimating BnB which relate to usual workday patterns.

Obviously this data will be very relevant to identifying neighborhoods popular with Christmas festivities, particularly with tourists who prefer AirBnB to commercial hotels.

2) I would suppose that there would be a much greater call for mental health services the day after 9/11 in NYC than San Francisco.  I can't think of how this data might be useful except to plan for maximum usage of mental health service system.

3) Virtually all respondents were age 18-23 which suggests either a self-selection bias of the on-line nature of the survey or an unusual distribution for the pub-going population in Armenia.

This survey may be useful to gain information of patrons aged 24 and below.
