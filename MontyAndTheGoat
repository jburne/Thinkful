This question really relies on whether the host has knowledge of where the prize is, or whether he is opening the door at random.

If at random:
	1/3 of the time you will learn where the prize is because you'll learn the car is behind the door the host opened. But this hasn't happened, thus you now have a 1/2 chance that your door has the prize. There is no advantage to switch.

If host knows:
	100% of the time the host can open a 'zonk' door.  You should switch.  It's easy to see this if you think about a more extreme situation.

	Assume there are 1,000,000 doors, so your door has a 1/1,000,000 chance of having the prize.  There is a 999,999/1,000,000 chance the prize is behind one of the other doors.  Whether or not you have the prize, the host can open 999,998 doors

	with probability 1/1,000,000 the host selects one door to remain closed and opens the rest.

	with probability 999,999/1,000,000 the host opens all the doors except the one he knows has the prize.

	The second situation is far more likely to have happened.  This is why you should switch.
