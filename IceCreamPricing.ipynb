    "## Musing about information which could be gained from coupons:\n",
    "\n",
    "A few days ago I was minding my own business, buying my weekly groceries at our local Food Lion.  After I bought my milk/eggs/cheese I passed by the ice cream isle where lo and behold, pints of Ben and Jerry’s ice cream were on special, 3 for $9.  Better still, there were three of my favorite: “Cherry Garcia”.  Given I’m currently studying data science with Thinkful, I pondered what information might be gleaned from customer response of this special.\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait, much like late night infomercials, there’s more!!  As I checked out, along with my receipt, I also received three coupons - printed automatically by the cash register.  Two were for \\\\$1.50 off future purchase of Ben and Jerry’s, a third was also \\\\$1.50 off Talenti Gelato, another premium ice cream.  Clearly this got me thinking about what sort of market research could be at work in my Food Lion."

    "## Some Interesting Factoids:\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s good to remember that, like most grocery stores these days, Food Lion issues a “loyalty card” for their customers (the MVP Customer Card) and use of that card is required for all in-store discounts, like the special on Ben and Jerry’s.  Curiously, even though the three coupons I received were for a manufacturer discount, buried in the small print on the back of the coupon was a requirement that the coupon must be in concert with a valid personal MVP card.  Thus, it seems clear that whatever trial they are using these coupons for, they are interested in tracking the response rate of individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, Food Lion sells a wide selection of other ice cream products from their own brand of ice cream (half gallon), moderately priced brands like Blue Bunny, and Bryers.  Curiously, no other ice cream were on sale."

    "## The Wacky World of Pricing Psychology\n",
    "\n",
    "__Price Anchoring:__ As the saying goes, the best way to sell a \\\\$2,000 watch is to put it right next to a \\\\$10,000 watch. But why? The culprit is a common cognitive bias called anchoring. Anchoring refers to the tendency to heavily rely on the first piece of information offered when making decisions….Placing premium products and services near standard options may help create a clearer sense of value for potential customers, who will view the less expensive options as a bargain in comparison. (https://www.helpscout.com/blog/pricing-strategies/ Gregory Ciotti, May 15th, 2016)\n",
    "\n",
    "What does this mean for Food Lion’s ice cream isle?  Large sections of that freezer are very similar brands, selling for approximately the same amount. Faced with many similar choices, many customers will experience “analysis paralysis”, and simply unconsciously decline to consider any ice cream.  By adding very expensive, although admittedly tasty. $4.95 pints of premium ice cream to the mix the grocer might well not expect to sell very many of those pints.  But once a customer considers the premium brand, and immediately rejects it as being too expensive, they have engaged in the analytic process of considering which ice cream to purchase.  Once begun, that analysis is more likely to continue until a purchase is made.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Stickiness of Sale Price:__ One of the difficulties of offering items “on-sale”, especially if that item has an established market price, is that the sale price can erode that established price if it is too memorable.  A pint of ice cream that everyone “expects” to sell for \\\\$5 could easily be harmed it customers began to question that price because of a sale selling it for \\\\$3.  But a sale of 3 for \\\\$9, doesn’t create the same memory - rather it was a discounted price as a reward for buying “in bulk”.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Comparative Pricing__ can Hurt Sales Selling by price comparison alone can end up hurting sales as there is a natural assumption that price is directly related to quality.  Think about it: When selling in the US, the Yugo was drastically cheaper than competing cars - yet they never had a significant volume in sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in my saga of my ice cream purchase, I find it fascinating that I received an identical coupon for Talenti - another premium ice cream typically priced exactly the same as Ben and Jerry’s.  Which coupon would I expect to see used by more customers? Ben and Jerry’s (because after eating 3 pints in a week I’ll want more) or Talenti - the gelato that’s so good it didn’t “have to” go on sale."

    "## Research Ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Sensitivity to Price__ Never wanting to be overlooking the obvious, it IS possible that this special is looking to research the sensitivity of sale on price.  If so, it would be a good idea to determine the effect of the sale price on Ben and Jerry’s on all other ice cream products.This can be done simply by comparing the sales data for the \"No Sale\" and \"With Sale\", one brand at a time.  Brands which have a marked change in sales could be considered sensitive to the pricing of Ben and Jerry's.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Coupon Usage Rates__ What is the usage rate of the \\\\$1.50 coupons when receiving them during a sale versus receiving them via traditional means?  When a customer receives a coupon at the cash register, the store will know their Loyalty number but then, and  at a later time if they chose to use that coupon. It would be interesting to see how usage rates of customers who are given coupons at time when purchasing Ben and Jerry's on sale, and customers who are given coupons when they AREN'T actively buying B&J. The \"treatment\" group has just shown a proclivity to buy B&J when on sale, the \"Control\" group might be more interested in that they haven't just satisfied a desire to purchase high quality ice cream.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Competition between Coupons__ When given competing coupons (B&J versus Talenti) at the same time, which is used more?\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\t__Maximizing Store Profit__ Determining pricing for maximum profit when selling competing brands.\n",
    "\n",
    "    While putting B&J on sale will, most probably, boost their sales -- it's an open question to see if store _profits_ from __all__ ice cream sales will improve.  To explore this question we'd have to know several other things:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Not only how Ben and Jerry's price effects other brands but how ALL brands effect one another.\n",
    "    1. What effects does a short term sale have on sales _after_ the sale is over.  That is, when Ben and Jerry's goes back off sale, do sales figures return to historic norms (because people believe they can wait for a sale) or do they go up (because the sale reminded them of how good Ben and Jerry's is.)\n"
