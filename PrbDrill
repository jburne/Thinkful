1.	P(HTTH) = P(HHHH) = P(TTHH) = (.5)^4 = 0.0625

2.  P('M)= 1-P(M)= 24/45

3.	This is not calculatable unless we know how to connect the 
	probability of ANY plane crash to the probability of A PARTICULAR PLANE crash (i.e. Bernice's plan)

	a) The problem states there is a 10% chance of Bernice traveling by plane next year.  Let's assume she does travel:  but how many times does she travel?  The answer key assumes she travels just once - but that's not a justified assumption.

	b) The probability of a plane crash at any time is .005% This sentence is ambiguous.  Does it refer to the probability of any randomly selected flight crashing? 



4.	Users decide for themselves whether to answer the survey. 		Whether consciously or not, users might not be truthful in 		their answers.  Finally, the act of being surveyed 				repeatedly may, in fact, change their behavior on the 			site.  

	OH, right, those who surf longer are over sampled.
